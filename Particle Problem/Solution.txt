(1) Introduction -random placement
My idea is I will place the shapes randomly then check if any shapes are overlap-
ping ,if it is overlapping then again randomly select positions .Now, keep running
this loop until a valid output comes ,now give the valid output containing non
overlapping shapes as final output


(2) Input file
The input file i.e. input.txt file should cotain the data as following manner
rectangle 24.27 15
circle 4
circle 2
circle 1
square 3
square 2
square 5


(3) Script
• For this script I have used matplotlib,random ,shapely library.
• First I have analysed the input.txt .then converted this data into a list
• Then,I have taken the dimensions of the rectangle as domain for our entire plot.
• I analysed the biggest shape.
• after that I have put shapes at random positions and checked if they are
overlapping with intersections() of shapely library, the final output will be
the figures which are not overlapping and inside the rectangle


(4) Output file
I have created a ouput.txt file by looping all the shapes their dimensions and
their positions one by one
5 Plotting and saving the image
I have plotted the genarated shapes by using matplotlib, first by sorting if the
shape is square or circle and then using the respective properties to plot

1 Introduction
My idea is to draw a circle of radius 55 and a square of of length 140. I have
used python and matplotlib library to perform this task.My basic idea is to
generate a point on the circle and use random to change the x axis by keeping
y constant or change the y axis by keeping x constant.
2 Script file
• First I opened Jupyter notebook. In that I imported random ,numpy
library,mathplotlib library
• First I created two empty list.Then I used random function to genarate a
angle between 0 to 2πand plotted a point in the circle by multiplying the
cos and sin of that angle with the radius and added in the respective lists.
• Then I have randomly selected x and y axis . Again ,randomly selected
whether to add or subtract 1.
• Then I checked whether the point is going outside the domain or not by
if else statements and finally appended the points in the list
• I have done this randomization for 1000 times and appended the co-
ordinates to the list.
• then I Plotted this using matplotlib
• I have done this for 3 particles
3 Shapes
• I have created the square by plotting the x coordinated and y coordinates
and joining them ` have created the circle by plotting points as multipli-
cation of sin and cos and ranging the variable from 0 to 2pi

4 CSV file
Now I have 6 lists , 3 containing x coordinates , 3 containing y coordinates.I
have imported csv module and created csv files for respective x and y axis
5 Image exporting
I have saved the jpg which came as output with the help of matplotlib command
savefig
